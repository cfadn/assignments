                <p>Deer in Nara, Japan, are well known for their bowing. Be warned, this tendency is deceptive. It is amusing the first time a deer bows before your majesty, hoping that you, almighty human, bestow a grainy cracker upon its humble fly swatting tongue. But lo, for when you bow and feed the deer a second time, it will sneakily assault you, for the humility was but a ruse the whole time!</p>
